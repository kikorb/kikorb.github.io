This is my first attempt to use jekyll. Since I thought it would be fun to try it
and it is about time I start writing a blog I will give it a try.

I am a ruby developer, most of the time I go on rails but I like to experiment
with other frameworks.

I am currently living in Spain, working in an IT company and doing what I love most.

If you want to know more about me here is my [linkedin me](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=37219289) profile.
