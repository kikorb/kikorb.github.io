For a while I have been wanting to write a blog again. But using blogger was not
the best thing for me since I wanted something a bit more technical.

I discovered github pages a while ago but it wasn´t until now that I had time to
try it. The first thing I came across in the documentation was [jekyll][jekyll] and the more
I was reading the more I was loving the idea of using md for the site.

So that´s it for now. Hopefully this will continue with a series of posts.

Have fun!

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to use Jekyll for your own page.
